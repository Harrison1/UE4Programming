# UE4Programming
C++ code for the video series "Introduction to UE4 Programming". UE4 version 4.6.1. 

The code in the tutorial series is out of date, this code is current with the latest API changes.

Keep in my mind I have named my project different that what Lauren has in the series. I called my project "ThirdPersonTutorial",
she called her's "TutorialCode".

My Tuturail HUD script is labeled with a lowercase "ud" in Hud. Lauren in the series called her script "TutorialCodeHUD", I called mine "TutorialCodeHud".
